## Prediction Analysis

### Environment setup: 
1. Install R packages used in these analyses from `prediction_analysis/renv.lock` using `renv::restore()`. 

2. Change the paths in `prediction_analysis/config.R` to point towards the data. 

3. The scripts `prediction_analysis/tract_models.R` and `prediction_analysis/local_connectome_models.R` run predictive models on tract profiles generated by pyAFQ and local connectomes generated by DSI Studio respectively. 

4. These predictive models can be found in `prediction_analysis/pRedict/R/run_model.R`. Details about model specifics can be found in Kruper et al., 2024. 

### Data Download
Phenotypic data can be acquired from HCP. Most of the predictors used in this analysis are part of the Open Access release, but `Age_in_Yrs` is considered restricted and requires additional steps. 

Local connectome data can be acquired from the data shared as part of [Rasero et al., 2021](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008347), here:  https://figshare.com/s/b97d2d1ba359e6458cb5

Tractometry data can be downloaded from Open Neuro Data, as detailed in Kruper et al., 2024.
